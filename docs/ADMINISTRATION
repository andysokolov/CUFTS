Administration
==============

When CUFTS is first installed, it will create an administrator account
called "admin" with a password of "admin".  Your first task is to log in as
admin and change the password.  You can do this in the "Account Settings"
screen.

Administrator accounts have access to do things like create other accounts,
create sites, change their site to anything, edit global resources, etc. 
The Quick Start section of the INSTALL document gives you a quick rundown on
creating sites and accounts.

Special Global Resources
========================

There is one special global resource (at the time of this writing) that you
should have a look at first.  It is the resource for CrossRef - an online
system which allows you to get metadata about a citation, including looking
up DOIs.  This is critical for a number of other resources which require
DOIs when linking to the article level.

CrossRef requires you to sign a license to use their service, however it is
free.  Once you have signed up and received an account name and password,
you should go into "edit" for CrossRef under the global resources and set
the authorization name and password fields.  The best solution is to sign a
license covering all your sites in one, however if individual sites have
their own licenses, they can set those fields in the local resources section
as well.

Global Resource Administration
==============================

You can update your global resources by uploading title lists, however once
you have done that you will be out of sync with the main CUFTS database. 
It's not a big deal as we will post new title lists as we load them into our
main system and you can then load the ones that are relevant to you.  If you
have global title lists that you think may be useful to others, we encourage
you to send them to us so we can include them in the main system.

If you've loaded the global resources which came with CUFTS, you wont have
to do much in the way of administration of global resources.  If you do wish
to load your own or update your title lists with the latest ones from the
main system (without reloading the database), here's how you do it...

Global Resource Settings
------------------------

Each resource has a number of general settings and may also have some
resource specific settings.  These can be changed for existing resources by
clicking "edit" beside them, or they can be set when creating a new
resource.

The general settings are...

name: the name of the resource which is displayed in the list, as well as in
the patron interface.

provider: the name of the resource provider.  This is displayed in the
resource list, and is used when deduping.

type: this is mostly a reference as to what this resource is for and doesn't
control anything yet, however in the future it may be used, so set it to
something meaningful.

module: this tells CUFTS which Perl module controls this resource.  This is
VERY critical to get correct - spelling mistakes, wrong case, etc., will
cause the module not to load.

active: whether the resource can be used or not.

Resource modules can define their own resource details if they need more
information to work properly.  Most resources have a database URL which will
be used to link to the database level if present.  Most also have a
configuration note which will show up on the local resources page if
present.  Other details you may see are authorization name and password for
logging into services, or base URL for specifying the base component of a
URL for constructing links to that resource.

Each resource also has a set of services it supports.  Checking off
services here will allow users to turn them on at the local level. 
Services which are not active at the global level are not available to be
activated at the local level.  See the GENERAL documentation for details on
what each service means.

Global Resource Title Lists
---------------------------

Title lists can be uploaded by clicking on the "bulk" link next to the
titles count.  From this screen you can browse to the title list on your
local machine and then upload it.  Once it is uploaded, you will need to run
"util/title_list_updater.pl" from the CUFTS base directory to do the actual
load.  It is split this way because some title list updates can take a while
(if they're updating a global resource which many sites have activated
locally) and it occasionally would time out the browser.  If you have
multiple people maintaining global lists, you may want to cronjob the
title_list_updater.pl script to run every 15 minutes or something like that.

Title lists are tab delimited, with the first row containing field names. 
They should match whatever fields are displayed when you click on the number
of titles in the resource (even if it's 0).

The update process will tell you how many records were added, and deleted. 
Due to how title lists vary and the lack of a single unique identifier,
there is no modification of records.  Records with changes will be deleted
and re-added.
