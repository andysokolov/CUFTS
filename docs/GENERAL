Services
========

Services are a general term for a level of linking or other action that
CUFTS can perform.  There are currently seven service types:

database: A link to the database level where a user would have to further
          search for fulltext.  This is a last ditch level, however some
          resources do not provide the ability to link in further than this.
fulltext: A link directly to the fulltext of an article, either HTML, PDF,
          or a page with further links to the fulltext.
holdings: A link to print holdings for a library - usually a link into their
          catalogue.
journal: A link to the journal level from where a user can normally pick a
         specific volume/issue to browse for fulltext.
metadata: This may not actually be a link, but may return extra data to be
          added to a request object for other resources to use.  See
          CrossRef for an example.
table of contents: A link to the issue level which should display all the
                   articles in the issue.  This may be a real TOC page, or
                   it may be a search for all articles in a specific issue.
web search: A link to a web search engine like Google.


Resolver
========

Here's (very roughly) how the resolver works...

1. Parse the OpenURL request and create a Request object.
2. Determine the user's site from Request or IP/domain information, 
   create a Site object
3. Find all active resources for Site, and create Resource objects
   for each one
4. Foreach Resource...
 5. Get all the active services for Resource
 6. Foreach service...
  7. If deduping is turned on and a link for this provider at this services
     level, goto next service
  8. Call "search_get$service" method on the resource to find any active
     titles 
  9. Filter those titles by the request information: date, embargo, volume, issue, etc.
  10. Call "build_link$service" to try to create links at that service level
     for titles which are not filtered out.  If a link is made, create a
     Result object for it.  Store all the Results.
11. Pass all the Results into the template chosen to display the results
