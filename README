## Overview
CUFTS is a free, open source (GPL) OpenURL link resolver and electronic resource management system designed for use by library consortia. It supports multiple sites from one server, online management tools, usage statistics, and an advanced journal list system.

Based upon an open knowledgebase of over 475 resources with nearly half a million title records, sites can individually activate resources they have access to, as well as subsets of titles for packages to which they only have partial subscriptions.

CUFTS includes a journal A-Z listing system which incorporates print record data to provide users with an integrated, comprehensive list of journals they have access to. Integrating the link resolver and journals lists means that subscription information only has to be maintained in one place. Also included is resource level ERM information for subscription information, license details, etc. It also includes a database A-Z list.

Developed at the Simon Fraser University Library http://www.lib.sfu.ca for the Council of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries (COPPUL) http://www.coppul.ca/ and the BC Electronic Library Network http://www.eln.bc.ca/, the main CUFTS server is currently handling fulltext link resolving for many members and associates http://researcher.sfu.ca/partners. Others sites are using the software independently, on their own servers.

Installation instruction can be found in docs/INSTALL or on the
