# This simply loads the basic and advanced config options into the same package for
# easy use by other classes.  The installation script should set up the BasicConfig.pm
# file for you, or you can edit it to change things like the base install directory,
# database name, etc.  AdvancedConfig contains stuff like built up database connection
# strings, etc.
